10 19 few weeks at a time
8 17 me to stay at the
6 19 them as soon as you
39 23 happened as a result of
17 17 i want to do some
6 28 of the home environment that
9 21 some of that money in

8 20 you had no reason to
19 24 first came to the united
7 23 and therein lies a tale
7 27 an assistant manager at the
10 17 a lot out of this
12 23 to try to do everything
6 19 a fact that we have
14 23 what exactly is it that
6 21 not trying to be mean
7 17 i know how hard i
13 24 with an average score of
6 21 is it really that bad
16 20 we see more and more
10 24 she told her mother that
13 18 he tells me he has
20 20 down at his desk and
7 19 it in his head that

7 20 able to see the moon
10 16 a lot of times a
7 24 is one of the relatively
7 27 building that looked like a
9 20 who are in danger of
9 25 the hardest part of being
8 19 picked it up in the

9 24 said he thought he could
6 25 is best understood in the
7 23 had never seen him look
6 24 be useful in helping you
7 23 and they went ahead and
9 24 much of their ability to
10 32 the development of civil society
16 20 way to keep in touch

6 21 you can expect to get
37 22 a lot of people wanted
6 32 adapted with permission from his
6 25 pastry or the sunglow pie
7 20 and i want to really
6 25 opened his eyes again and
6 23 we also need to address
7 19 be the best at what
7 22 already has one of the
7 18 have to be sort of
15 21 to pass for more than
71 17 at the sound of a
7 19 like to get on with
17 23 are going to think that
10 19 do not have as much
6 18 a voice as i could
10 19 of the people in it
13 19 that you can buy at
13 21 beads of sweat on his

8 24 he first heard about the
13 22 the phone rings in the
8 23 very few people who are
6 18 we have to live by
69 16 do you do if you
13 27 the general feeling is that
6 23 may also be required to
21 20 is that how it works
11 18 i want her to stay
7 29 that there are certain people
7 27 have been eliminated in the
7 28 has been a characteristic of
6 28 the balcony of his apartment
8 24 that we know very little
6 19 going to do so well
13 22 going to stay with him
25 19 and i think she has
8 19 sixth year in a row
6 26 to stability in the region
34 18 so long as they do
12 27 contributed to a decline in
6 18 in fact it is only
7 18 left home to go to
9 24 suggest that this is the
9 20 the show is based on
12 28 responses to the question of
7 26 the ability to think about
7 26 one pays much attention to
68 18 and i want them to
133 20 you are going to see
10 16 in one at a time

8 22 she was exposed to the
6 25 the story is really about
6 28 one of the greatest athletes
7 25 part of the discussion of

9 21 by the changes in the
7 31 edition of the political junkie
6 24 in which the audience is
6 24 is still standing in the
7 25 one of the other problems
11 27 i stopped thinking about it
8 29 arrive at the same conclusion
9 24 it was an unusually warm

11 21 up to this point that
11 20 we are at a critical

7 21 we are now being told
9 21 to have at least five
8 17 front of him as a
8 23 on a personal level and
13 17 a way to get this
12 16 is a look at how
9 19 top of the hour for

19 19 it was in the paper
7 22 stay here for the rest
14 22 and what you should do
6 22 groups to come up with
6 24 the lives of these three
12 22 all of the good things

10 23 i think the pressure is
13 24 what are the symptoms of
16 18 to get to know his
6 22 come into my heart and
6 24 with a possible range of
8 22 that she and the other
28 23 in saudi arabia and the
15 23 who are you working for
7 21 or less than half the
9 24 grow up without a father

7 26 i really want to emphasize
17 21 the young man and his
8 23 his pledge not to raise
6 28 six months after her husband
8 24 a different view of this
6 23 the extreme edge of the
6 19 you who live in the
13 27 had been turned upside down
6 28 which are the most important
118 24 the fact that the united
6 20 to say that i should
8 21 from one of the state
12 20 but i am telling you
58 26 going to be an interesting
6 24 what might be done about

9 21 it got me to thinking
8 43 enrolled in introductory psychology courses
10 31 begin a series of conversations
10 26 captures the spirit of the
11 15 us a clue as to
14 31 questions are being asked about

7 21 was trying to make an
39 18 that i do not know
12 26 and the environment in the
8 17 i had to take out
9 27 is not surprising then that
8 22 you felt that you were
